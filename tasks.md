##make a github account

When you are done I will add you to the "collaborators" on my project.

1. Clone my repo: `git clone git@github.com:unenglishable/git-lightning`

That's it!  You're done.

##make a directory in there with your team name (or username)

`mkdir team_name`

All your team's code will go in here.

##start writing some code

Using any language you want, complete the following tasks.

1. hello world
  - The program should output: "hello world"
  - You can check what files have changed with `git status`
  - When you are done, do `git add [file]`
  - Check again with `git status` to make sure you have added the correct file.
  - Do `git commit` when you have staged the correct files.  Otherwise do `git
    reset [file]` on files you do not want to commit.
